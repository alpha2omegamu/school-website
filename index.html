                     <h3>Hogwarts</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p class='text-justify'>
                        At some point in the tenth century, four of the greatest witches and wizards that ever lived 
                        founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Their names were Godric Gryffindor, 
                        Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. As The Sorting Hat told us, their 
                        reason for doing so was because they had the ‘selfsame yearning, to make the world’s best magic school’, 
                        and once they did, each created their own house to represent a personality and skill that they wanted to nurture. 
                     </p>
                     <p class='text-justify'>
                        Gryffindor students embodied bravery and chivalry; Ravenclaw, intelligence and wit; Hufflepuff, 
                        loyalty and fair play; and Slytherin, the values of being sly and cunning.It’s a popular wizarding 
                        theory that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts.

                     <h3>Hogwarts Core Values</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <h5>WISDOM-KNOWLEDGE</h5>
                     <p>
                        The gift of sound judgment shall be internalized by every Hogwarts. The ability to use their knowledge 
                        is a perfection that every Hogwarts aims to achieve which is anchored from the concept of Hogwarts as 
                        the seat of intellectual refinement. Through all of these the act of knowing and accumulating a body 
                        of facts and information comes along.
                     </p>
                     <h5>COMPETENCE</h5>
                     <p>
                        The Hogwarts way is always geared towards competence in all endeavors. Such that, one is capable to do 
                        beyond what is expected of him or her. Competence can only be acquired after a thorough process of refinement.
                     </p>
                     <h5>RESPONSIBILITY</h5>
                     <p>
                        Hogwarts expects from its students to develop the ability to respond to the needs and demands of the 
                        present life conditions. Being responsible enough to become good citizens of the country can pave the way 
                        for a brighter future of the generations to come.
                     </p>
                     <h5>INNOVENTIVENESS</h5>
                     <p>
                        An Hogwarts student seeks to introduce new things. As an inherent skill that is cascaded within the framework 
                        of the institution, introducing new methods and ideas to make changes, is an indicator of a society in progress 
                        which teachers shall purposely aim to develop in every student.
                     </p>
                     <h5>LOVE</h5>
                     <p>
                        Love is the core of every family. It creates a special bond among all peoples of the world. Hogwarts aims to 
                        develop in every child the love for ones self, family and society that is geared towards progress.
                     </p>
                     <h5>INTEGRITY</h5>
                     <p>
                        The Hogwarts way contemplates on the wholeness of every student who can speak his mind and express his feelings 
                        with utmost sincerity. The state of being humble or modest is expected to be seen from every Hogwarts student. 
                        The school aims to produce students who can <i>fly or soar high with their dreams yet still grounded with their 
                        sense of humility</i>.
                     </p>
                     <h5>SELF-DESCIPLINE</h5>
                     <p>
                        Hogwarts aims to help every student to develop in them a habit of system and order by way of training and 
                        conditioning them to become obedient and self-controlled. Organizing ones self gives an edge over the others.
                     </p>
                     <h5>TRUTHFULNESS</h5>
                     <p>
                        "Honesty is the best policy". Every Hogwarts deserves to know the truth, embrace it and to be witnessing citizens
                        of the community. Hogwarts aims to help every student to acquire the value of truthfulness towards becoming better 
                        citizens of the country.
                     </p>
                     <h5>GENEROSITY</h5>
                     <p>
                        With generosity in diversity, the Hogwarts way creates a challenge to every student to manifest a genuine spirit 
                        of sharing and giving despite the existence of diverse cultures, religion and ethnicities. Hogwarts believes in 
                        the spirit of generosity across culture, religion and race.
                     </p>
                     <h5>LOYALTY</h5>
                     <p>
                        It is the aim of this institution to inspire all students and to develop in them the sense of undying support to 
                        their Alma Mater, mentors, classmates and friends.

                  This year, Hogwarts School will host two Open Houses; Sunday, October 23 at 1:00 p.m. and Thursday, November 18 at 9:30 a.m. 
                  Open Houses are a fantastic way for prospective families to see the Hogwarts campus, 
                  learn about our compelling continuum, as well as meet staff, faculty and current students.

               <p>
                  Required testing depends on the age of the child applying to attend Hogwarts. Once you have submitted an inquiry form, 
                  you will be able to access the Admissions Portal which includes a comprehensive list of all necessary testing and required forms.

                  Hogwarts School believes that qualified students who desire an education should not be denied that opportunity 
                  because of economic hardship.  Thus, we are proud to offer financial aid (for new and existing Hogwarts families) 
                  that helps us provide a balanced school community and at the same time keep the school financially healthy.  
                  Please note that financial aid application for new families can only be processed if the student’s admissions application is complete.
